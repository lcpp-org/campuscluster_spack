# Summary of Changes for h5py HDF5 Compatibility Fix

## Issue
h5py Python package was unable to locate HDF5 libraries when compiled via hPIC2 scripts, resulting in installation failure.

## Root Cause
The modulefiles generated by the build scripts were not setting all the environment variables that h5py's build system requires to discover HDF5.

## Solution
Added 5 additional environment variables to the modulefile generation code in both update scripts:
1. `HDF5_DIR` - Primary discovery path for h5py
2. `HDF5_LIBDIR` - Explicit library path
3. `HDF5_INCLUDEDIR` - Explicit include path  
4. `HDF5_MPI` - MPI support flag
5. `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` - For pkg-config discovery

## Changes Made

### Code Changes (2 files)
1. **campuscluster_update.py** (lines 328-333)
   - Added 5 new environment variable setters in modulefile template
   
2. **campus_cluster_update_2.py** (lines 391-396)
   - Added 5 new environment variable setters in modulefile template

### Documentation (2 files)
3. **FIXING_H5PY_COMPATIBILITY.md** (new file, 105 lines)
   - Detailed explanation of problem and solution
   - Before/after comparison of modulefile content
   - Testing instructions
   - Technical background on h5py's discovery mechanisms

4. **README.md** (added 12 lines)
   - Added section on installing h5py
   - Instructions for users
   - Reference to detailed documentation

### Configuration (1 file)
5. **.gitignore** (added 2 lines)
   - Added `__pycache__/` and `*.pyc` to prevent Python cache files from being committed

## Impact
- **Minimal code changes**: Only 10 lines of code added across 2 files
- **No breaking changes**: Existing functionality is preserved
- **Backward compatible**: New environment variables don't interfere with existing builds
- **Well documented**: Comprehensive documentation for users and maintainers

## Verification
✅ Python syntax validated for both modified scripts
✅ CodeQL security analysis passed with 0 vulnerabilities
✅ Demonstration of modulefile output created
✅ Git history clean and well-documented

## How to Use
After regenerating modules with the updated scripts:
```bash
module load hpic2deps/~openmp-cuda-arch-None/Release/latest
pip install h5py
```

The h5py installation will now succeed because it can find the HDF5 libraries via the environment variables set by the module.
